# üêç learningpython

Welcome to my learning journey in Python programming!

This repository is a collection of Jupyter notebooks and exercises that document my hands-on exploration of Python. It includes practice scripts, mini-projects, and concept notes as I work through the fundamentals and practical applications of the language.

## üìò What's Inside

Each notebook builds on a different Python concept:

| Notebook                          | Description                                      |
|----------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| `python_1.ipynb`                 | Introduction to Python syntax and variables      |
| `python_2.ipynb`                 | Data structures: tuple, list, set, and dictionary|
| `python_3_(Pandas_and_if_loop).ipynb` | Working with Pandas and conditional logic    |
| `python_4_(for_loop).ipynb`      | Understanding and applying `for` loops           |
| `python_5_(basic_pandas).ipynb`  | Basic operations with Pandas DataFrames          |
